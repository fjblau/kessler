2003-DK-02,DTUsat 1,,,2003-06-30,,,,,DTUsat (DTUsat-1) was built by students at the Technical University of Denmark and as such provided a platform for hands-on teaching of space technology and systems engineering. The student satellite’s primary mission was to test an electrodynamic tether to be used as a tool for space debris mitigation. The tether would reduce the deorbiting time. Secondary payloads were a camera and the successful sun sensor based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). The sensor has now flown on six missions. Contact was never established with DTUsat-1.,Denmark
